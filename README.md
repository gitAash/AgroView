# NDVI-Based Vegetation Analysis from Satellite Images 🌱🛰️

This project uses NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to analyze vegetation health from satellite images using Python and PyTorch.

## 🔍 What it does
- Loads and classifies satellite images
- Calculates NDVI using Red and NIR bands
- Highlights areas with healthy vegetation
- Generates a short NDVI report

## 📌 Why it's relevant
- Uses satellite image processing – important in remote sensing
- Shows how vegetation health can be monitored using NDVI
- Can support agriculture, forestry, and climate research

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Matplotlib
- EuroSAT Dataset (RGB)

## 📈 Sample NDVI Report

 Image Class : AnnualCrop
 Healthy Area % : 0.0% (NDVI > 0.4)
 NDVI Range : -0.12 to 0.25

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run all cells
3. View the image, NDVI map, and report

## 📁 Dataset
- EuroSAT RGB (Land Use Classification)

## 💡 Ideal Use Cases
- Vegetation monitoring
- Remote sensing research
- Environmental studies
